# zoom_rainbow

### This is an p5.js application, which will display an rainbow based on image classification.

This code is based on the coding challenge: [Zoom Annotations with Machine Learning and p5.js](https://thecodingtrain.com/CodingChallenges/157-zoom-annotations.html)

**Thanks [Daniel Shiffman](https://github.com/shiffman) for the great coding challenge!**

## Setup:

- I recommend to use VS Code with the p5 plugin.
- It gives you a server and all you need to run it locally.

- Train your own model using the [Teachable Machine](https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com/)
- Export your model and paste it into sketch.js
- Start the server (press go live in the bottom right corner in VS code)

## Usage in Zoom

[ Again I followed the recommendation of Shiffman ]

- I used OBS to window capture the output of the application in the browser.
- Starting the virtual camera let you stream to Zoom.
